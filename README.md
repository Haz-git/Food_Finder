Hello,

This project is a simple search engine that uses the fetch API to get and post results from themealdb.com. Through this project, I learned how to use the fetch api, process the data from the meal DB, and dynamically insert its data upon user request.

To use this webapp, simply clone this folder and run on live server. Or, download the files into the same directory and run using your browser.
